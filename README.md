# House Price Prediction Project

This is **Task 1** of my internship at *Skill Craft Technology*.  
I developed a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices based on:
- Square foot area
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
